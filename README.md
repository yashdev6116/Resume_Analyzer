# Resume_Analyzer

This project uses Python and essential data science libraries to streamline the process of analyzing and classifying resumes. The Resume Analyzer reads a large dataset of resumes, each tagged by job categories, and applies a series of preprocessing steps to clean and format the data. By extracting text from HTML resume formats, removing non-essential information, and categorizing resumes, this tool creates a well-structured dataset ready for deeper NLP analysis or machine learning model training. The project is highly useful for HR teams and recruitment platforms aiming to automate the initial phases of resume screening, reducing manual review time and enabling faster candidate evaluation.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Data Processing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Classification

Features:

Data Loading and Exploration: Reads and inspects the resume dataset, revealing key trends and insights that help refine the classification approach.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleans the raw data by removing HTML tags, redundant text, and extraneous symbols, leaving only essential resume text.

Text Categorization and Organization: Organizes resumes by predefined job categories (e.g., HR, Aviation) to structure data for supervised learning tasks.

NLP-Ready Dataset Creation: Formats the data for natural language processing and machine learning models, setting up advanced analytical possibilities.

Scalability and Flexibility: Designed to accommodate various resume formats and can be easily modified for different classification tasks.
